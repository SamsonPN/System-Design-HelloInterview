    "* Redis is a self-described \"data structure store\" that's in-memory and single-threaded\n",
    "    * Single-Threaded: simplifies order of operations and makes executing them really fast\n",
    "        - the first request is always the first one served and all subsequent requests have to wait\n",
    "        - you don't have to worry about complex locking mechanisms\n",
    "            * don't have multiple threads to coordinate for access to a single resource\n",
    "            * no deadlocks since no other threads or shared resources to wait on\n",
    "        - avoids race conditions since operations only happen once at a time\n",
    "    * In-Memory: makes operations very fast since it avoids the overhead of reading data from disk into memory through disk I/O\n",
    "        - but we have a tradeoff of speed for durability, meaning data saved in memory will not persist\n",
    "        - there are ways to minimze data loss but you don't get the same guarantees compared to a relational database\n",
    "* fundamental data structures supported by Redis:\n",
    "    - strings\n",
    "    - hashes (objects)\n",
    "    - lists\n",
    "    - sets\n",
    "    - sorted sets (priority queues)\n",
    "    - bloom filters\n",
    "    - geospatial indexes\n",
    "    - time series\n",
    "* also supports different communication patterns like Pub/Sub and Streams\n",
    "* __core structure underneath Redis is a key-value store__\n",
    "    - keys = strings\n",
    "    - values = any data structures supported by Redis\n",
    "    - __the way you organize the keys will be the way your organize your data and scale your Redis cluster__"
